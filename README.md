## Food Go

A restaurant ordering React Native app for users to order food items at discounted prices.

In my final year I developed an app designed to target the ongoing issue of food crisis more specifically food waste. The app is intended for consumers to purchase food at more affordable prices and thus will be preventing items that would otherwise be thrown to waste. Users can view local food items by entering their location within the app, a google location API fetches the input location and yelp's API gathers restaurant data from the location and then displays restaurants in the area. Restaurant owners can insert their food items, images, prices onto the app thatâ€™s then inserted into the database. Users also have the opportunity to filter what items can be delivered or picked up and the API filters options between food items that are available for pickup or delivery to be displayed on the front-end.
