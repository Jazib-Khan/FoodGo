## Food Go

Food go is a mobile app that allows food sharing from major restaurants and takeaways for users who need or wish to consume food at cheaper to no costs compared to current market prices. The aim of this project is to help reduce food wastages that in regular store guideline circumstances go to waste. This is done by means of stores, restaurants and takeaways registering perfectly edible food products that they would otherwise throw to waste.

The need for the application is one that looks out for society’s needs as it’s been estimated that we produce enough food to feed the world’s population several times over. Yet millions of tonnes of food are destroyed every year, in order to keep market prices high whilst over millions of people starve to death per year as they cannot afford to buy food.
