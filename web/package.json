  "description": "Food go is a cross-platform mobile app that allows food sharing from major supermarkets, restaurants and takeaways for users who need or wish to consume food at cheaper to no costs compared to current market prices. The aim of this project is to help reduce food wastages that in regular store guideline circumstances go to waste. This is done by means of stores, restaurants and takeaways registering perfectly edible food products that they would otherwise throw to waste. The software also provides a web-based admin interface which allows supermarkets, restaurants and takeaways to register a selection of food items, types of food and categorising dietary needs. It will also provide full CRUD functionality.",
